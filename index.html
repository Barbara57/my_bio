                I am a 58year old young woman with a life full of interesting journeys, through it all I have come to this place and time in my life to be grateful for each and everyday. Thanking my Lord for bringing me through it all. 
                I am the mother of a 37 yr old son, grandmother of 3 grandchildren and 1 great grandson. Look at God pretty good for a young woman three generations! I am truly grateful, for my God-daughter and all the rest of my children and grands, there are many.
                I have always been a people person, had no idea it would bring me to the stage in my life as a servant of God people. I gladly took the job.
