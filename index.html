                I am a 58year old young woman with a life full of interesting journeys, through it all I have come to this place and time in my life to be grateful for each and everyday. Thanking my Lord for bringing me through it all. 
                I am the mother of a 37 yr old son, grandmother of 3 grandchildren and 1 great grandson. Look at God pretty good for a young woman three generations! I am truly grateful, for my God-daughter and all the rest of my children and grands, there are many.
                I have always been a people person, had no idea it would bring me to the stage in my life as a servant of God people. I gladly took the job.

        History
        
        
        </h4>
        
        <p>
        I was raised in Wellston, Mo. by both of my parents in the same house. Prentiss & Gladys Scott even in my days it was rare. but there two parent families in the hood. We were the average working class family. I am the 2nd oldest of the 6 of us. The oldest girl a the mother hen, daddy's girl which cost me to get in trouble with mom a lot of time. I had a very decent childhood penty of material stuff. My parent were very hardworking people, I feel that maybe the reason they are gone on. Spending a lot of time working and not taking better 
        care of themselves. Bless them both, I was raise with a lot of morals, matters and values> Education was big in our household. I graduated from High School in 1977, didn't attended college due to my own stubborn ways. Leave home after school got married had a baby had to get a job, went against everything I was taught, but never forgot what I had learned. A lot of us sometimes when we are young really think we know it all LOL!!! I had a very hard way for awhile, thanks to my parents and grandparents for raisingand teaching me the right way cost me to stop in my maddest and turn myself back around.
